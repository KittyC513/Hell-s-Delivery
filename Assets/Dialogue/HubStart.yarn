Player1: Hehehe... I know you only wear that hat because you're bald. 
Player1: I can count with all zero of my fingers how many strands of hair you have.
Player2: *Gasp!* First of all, I have a solid three strands!
Player1: I wouldn't be surprised if your lack of hair is what landed you in Hell. 
Player1: Manslaughter by blinding drivers with your bald head.
Player2: There's no way you weren't a bully in your previous life.
Player1: Just your bully. Comes with dental coverage and a pension plan, baby.

Devil: You know what else comes with dental coverage and a pension plan?

Player1: And what's it to you if we don't do it?
Devil: Tell you what. Whoever can successfully deliver the most packages will receive a promotion.
Player2: !!!
Devil: I am only expecting positive reviews on Yelp. Keke.
